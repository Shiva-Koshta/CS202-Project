Ques:

1. do we have to maintain a symbol table also?


what to do:
1. we have to write the EBNF for  each type of expresion/function/loops/if else/
2.  P1# (double precision), N$ (string), A9 (integer), M! (single precision) {Integer is the default}
3. KeyWords : NOT, AND, OR, XOR, DATA, DEF FNx, DIM, END, FOR, TO, NEXT, GOSUB, GOTO, IF, THEN, INPUT, PRINT, REM, RETURN, STOP, 
4.
